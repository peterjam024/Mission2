    <p>
        I would love to learn from this class what I need to do to be able to be a better candidate for jobs. I would like to understand
        how to program in ASP.net so that I am desired in my career. I would like to become good friends with Professor Hilton, I would like to
        learn what it is that he does to make everyone happy with him. It would also be nice to get a good grade in the end, but as long as I
        learn the material, that is honestly the most important part.
